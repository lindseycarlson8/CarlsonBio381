Lindsey is a member of a collaborative, McIntire-Stennis funded project designed to explore how the interacting influences of forest gaps and input of woody debris affect stream structure and function in the northern hardwood forests. Lindseyâ€™s focus is on the impacts of forest succession and habitat heterogeneity on stream microbial biodiversity and function. Lindsey graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2019 with a B.Sc. in Biology.
